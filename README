== Mod Manager / Mod Builder ==

Mod Builder is a tool that lets you easily create modifications for SMF.
It currently includes the following components:
- Agent (screen hosting all the editor windows)
- Editor (the actual mod editor)

In version 2.0 I am planning to replace both for a powerful IDE.
